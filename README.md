**PurpleRed** is a closed-loop decentralized gambling protocol built on the **Rootstock (RSK)** network and secured by the massive hashing power of **Bitcoin**. We have redefined the gambling industry by eliminating the "black box" of centralized servers. In our architecture, we have removed the "Black" from the roulette—leaving only **Red** and **Purple**.

The protocol is a transparent financial system where investors, traffic affiliates, and players interact within a trustless environment governed by pure mathematics.

## 👁️ Mechanics: Player Plays Dice with Bitcoin

Forget rigged scripts and server-side RNGs. The outcome of every round is calculated using a 6-block hash from the Rootstock (RSK) network, anchored by Bitcoin's miners.

* **Quantum-Entropic Hashrate:** Pure mathematical entropy derived from the blockchain.
* **Immutable Integrity:** The block hash is unknown until the moment the block is mined.
* **On-Chain Audit:** Every spin is a permanent transaction on the blockchain, verifiable by anyone, anywhere, forever.
* **Economic Security:** The cost of manipulating the result exceeds any potential payout.

## 📊 Protocol Economics

PurpleRed operates on a standard European Roulette **House Edge of 2.7%**. In traditional casinos, this margin goes to the owner. In PurpleRed, this **2.7% of total turnover** is transparently distributed among protocol participants:

**Distribution of House Edge (100% of profit share):**
* **44.4%** ($W \times 0.012$) — Liquidity Providers (Investors)
* **29.6%** ($W \times 0.008$) — Referral Partners
* **14.8%** ($W \times 0.004$) — **$PURPLE** Staking Pool
* **9.3%** ($W \times 0.0025$) — Security Reserve Fund
* **1.9%** ($W \times 0.0005$) — Maintenance (Croupier Mechanism)

## 🏛️ For Investors: Become the "House"

Stop holding passive BTC—start owning the bank.
* **Native BTC Yield:** Unlike other DeFi protocols, your rewards are generated and paid in Bitcoin.
* **Turnover-Driven Revenue:** Earn from every bet placed. Your balance grows with the protocol's volume, not just player losses.
* **ERC-4626 Standard:** Vaults utilize the industry-standard for yield-bearing tokens, ensuring non-custodial security.
* **Emergency Exit:** Built-in mechanisms allow for guaranteed liquidity withdrawal in emergency scenarios.

## 🤝 For Partners: On-Chain Referral Assets

We have turned referral codes into high-value digital assets.
* **Quality Filter:** Creating a unique invite code requires a **0.1 BTC** deposit into the LP Pool. This ensures an elite network of professional partners.
* **Turnover vs. RevShare:** Earn **0.8% of the TOTAL turnover**. 
    * *Traditional:* If your player wins $1M, you earn $0.
    * *PurpleRed:* If your player wins $1M, you instantly receive **$8,000**.
* **Permanent Binding:** Players are linked to your address on-chain forever.

## 🌐 Decentralization: Deploy Your Own Frontend

PurpleRed is a protocol, not a website. It is designed to be unstoppable.
* **Open Source UI:** Any community member can deploy their own frontend mirror on a private domain or **IPFS**.
* **Censorship Resistant:** As long as the Bitcoin blockchain exists, the protocol remains active and profitable.
* **Direct Interaction:** Users can interact with the smart contracts directly, bypassing any localized blocks.

## 🚀 Mainnet Deployment & Partnership

The smart contracts are currently undergoing final optimization before **Mainnet Launch**. We are currently seeking one **Key Strategic Partner**.

**Investment Opportunity:**
* Revenue share via **$PURPLE** token allocation.
* Premium yield rates for large-scale initial LP deposits.
* Funds will be allocated towards audits by leading US cybersecurity firms and Tier-1 global marketing.
